# A. Onshape Basics (WIP)

## Introduction

Level 2 begins here! In this phase, you'll dive into a series of Onshape exercises and projects designed to strengthen your CAD skills within an FTC environment.

&#x20;Level 2A is divided into three main sections:

* **Sketching and Part Design**
* **Multi-Part Part Studios**
* **Assemblies**

Each section provides a learning course to build your skills, followed by an exercise to apply them directly in an FTC context.

## Learning Courses <a href="#learning-courses" id="learning-courses"></a>

[Onshape's Learning Center](https://learn.onshape.com/) offers free courses and articles covering everything from basic document navigation and sketching to advanced surface and sheet metal modeling. It's a great resource for both beginners and experienced users.

While we use a few selected courses to build foundational CAD skills in Onshape, the majority of the curriculum is project-based. Each course includes short videos and practice models, with an expected completion time of 2â€“4 hours.
