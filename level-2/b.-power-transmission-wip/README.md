# B. Power Transmission (WIP)

## Introduction

Up to this point, the models you've built have been structural components—but that's just one part of a robot. To make a robot move and perform tasks, motors that generate rotational motion are essential. In Level 2B, you'll start working with basic power transmissions, which include motors, bearings, shafts, gears, belts, and chains—all used to convert rotational motion into functional movement.

This stage focuses on the fundamentals of power transmissions, with a special emphasis on modeling them in CAD. Motor selection and power transmission ratio calculations will be covered later in Stage 2, where you'll explore multiple different mechanisms in greater detail.

In this stage, there are exercises designed to practice modeling simple power transmissions in the form of stand-alone gearboxes. I\


## Examples

Take a look below at some examples of different types of power transmissions found in robots.
