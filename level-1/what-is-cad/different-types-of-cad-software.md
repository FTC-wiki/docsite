Onshape is a cloud-based CAD software that makes it easy for teams to design and collaborate. It has great tutorials for beginners and a file management system that keeps everything organized. While it may not have every advanced feature found in other CAD programs, it has everything FTC teams need to build and refine their robots, and it's constantly improving with regular updates. One of its biggest strengths is real-time collaboration, allowing multiple teammates to work on the same design from anywhere, as long as they have an internet connection. Since it doesn’t require a high-end computer, many FTC teams have switched to Onshape for its flexibility and accessibility.

Autodesk Fusion 360 is a popular choice among hobbyists and combat robotics enthusiasts, largely because it's free for these users. This widespread adoption has led to an abundance of high-quality tutorials, making it easy to learn. It also features cloud saving, helping prevent data loss and ensuring seamless access across devices. A standout advantage of Fusion 360 is its native compatibility with macOS, unlike many other CAD programs. However, it doesn’t handle large assemblies, which may be a consideration for complex designs.

SolidWorks is a powerful, industry-standard CAD software widely used in engineering and product design. It offers robust 3D modeling tools, simulation capabilities, and manufacturing integration, making it ideal for professional workflows. Unlike cloud-based CAD programs, SolidWorks runs on Windows and requires a capable computer, but its precision and extensive feature set make it a go-to choice for teams working on complex assemblies. While it lacks built-in real-time collaboration, it integrates with data management tools to streamline teamwork. Many FTC teams use SolidWorks for its advanced modeling capabilities, especially when designing intricate mechanisms and optimizing parts for manufacturing.
