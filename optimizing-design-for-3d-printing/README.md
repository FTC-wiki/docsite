# Optimizing Design for 3D Printing

3D printing offers huge advantages in FTC; custom parts, quick iteration, and geometric flexibility. However, to truly benefit, parts must be **designed specifically for printing**. Poorly designed models can waste time, filament, and lead to mechanical failures. Designing for 3D printing isn’t just about making a part printable—it’s about making it strong, efficient, and cleanly manufactured _on your specific printer and material_.

### [**Part Orientation and Layer Strength**](orientation-and-layer-strength.md)

The first rule of design-for-printing is understanding that **layer lines are the weakest axis**. In FDM printers, parts are built up in layers, so a vertical cylinder is much more likely to split along layer lines than a horizontally printed one. Design your part so that the direction of expected load lines up with the part’s strongest axis—parallel to the print bed. A good rule of thumb is: **don’t cantilever parts along the Z-axis unless absolutely necessary**.

### [**Wall Thickness and Support Avoidance**](wall-strength-and-shells.md)

Thin walls may save weight, but if your walls are too thin to properly accommodate your printer’s nozzle (typically 0.4 mm), print quality and strength will suffer. In general, walls should be **multiples of your nozzle width** (e.g., 0.8 mm, 1.2 mm) and support at least 3 perimeter shells for structural parts. Use **chamfers** instead of sharp overhangs or bridges, and try to orient parts to print without support whenever possible—it reduces post-processing time and improves finish quality.

### [**Fillets, Chamfers, and Strength**](load-distribution.md)

Sharp corners are stress concentrators and often lead to cracks or delamination. Add **fillets or chamfers** on all internal corners to distribute stress more evenly and help layer adhesion. Rounded edges also improve print aesthetics and reduce warping, especially with materials like ABS or Nylon. For structural parts, add **ribs** and **gussets** instead of just increasing wall thickness—these features strengthen the part without adding unnecessary mass or filament usage.

### [**Lightweighting and Print Efficiency**](../weight-savings-pocketing.md)

Solid blocks of plastic are rarely necessary. Use **internal lattice patterns, cutouts, and hexagonal pockets** to remove mass without losing structural integrity. Infill percentage can also be reduced (30–40% is often plenty for FTC parts) to save time and material. For parts where stiffness matters, consider using higher walls and perimeters instead of denser infill.

### [**Material-Specific Design**](filaments.md)

Different materials behave differently. **PLA** is rigid but brittle, **PETG** is flexible and strong but warps more, and **Nylon** is tough and fatigue-resistant but harder to print accurately. Your part design should reflect the material it’s made from—snap fits and flexing clips work better in Nylon or TPU, but rigid mounts and brackets are best in PLA+ or PETG.

By intentionally designing your parts with 3D printing in mind—considering orientation, tolerances, wall thickness, and material—you’ll get cleaner prints, stronger parts, and fewer headaches. Great FTC teams don’t just use printers—they **design for them**.
