# Orientation and Layer Strength

_\[Illustration: Same bracket printed vertically vs. horizontally, showing layer lines and failure direction]_\
**CAD Model**: `Simple L-Bracket.stl` (with load direction arrow annotations)

**Key Takeaway**: Always print structural parts so that **layers run along the direction of expected stress**, not across it. Vertical prints fail faster at stress points.
