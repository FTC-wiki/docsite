# How to build competitive robots

To create a competitive robot, we will need to cover both the fundamentals and advanced techniques in FTC robot design. While examples are given in Onshape, the content can be used in any CAD software, including Fusion360 and Solidworks.



### Strategic Design

Strategic Design in the most fundamental starting point to building a performing chassis. It can boost any team's performance . Strategic design in summary is the factors that go into what robot your team decides to build, creating a successful build season schedule for getting it done, and executing it well for competitions. It's about priorities and tradeoffs. It's about designing a robot and playing the game within your capabilities. Without a proper strategy and team structure, you cannot succeed.

Once you’ve grasped the fundamentals of [robot architecture](https://app.gitbook.com/o/NEBZrvLHg2FrfYjBTIph/s/oV5kYQdtEQXrvJysnhMt/), the next step to building a truly competitive FTC robot is refining your design process and engineering workflow. Top-performing teams go beyond basic functionality—they emphasize efficiency, precision, and adaptability from the earliest planning stages.

### Design Workflow

One of the most important habits to develop is a CAD-first workflow. Rather than cutting parts and experimenting physically, strong teams model their entire robot in CAD before building anything. This includes not just major systems like drivetrains and lifts, but also fine details like screw clearances, cable routing, and range-of-motion constraints. Designing in CAD allows you to check for part collisions, run mechanical simulations, and iterate quickly without wasting time or materials. Platforms like Onshape are especially popular due to their collaboration features, and built-in hardware libraries.

Prototyping is still essential, but it should be fast and intentional. The goal of prototyping isn’t just to build something that works—it’s to answer specific design questions. Effective teams use cardboard, foam board, or scrap polycarbonate to test geometry and mechanism concepts before committing to a final version. Each prototype should focus on validating a single factor, such as roller spacing, gear ratios, or sensor placement. Teams that document their results thoroughly, using photos, videos, and notes, are better equipped to justify decisions in their engineering portfolio and iterate with purpose.

### Design Philosophy

Modular design philosophy also plays a key role in competitive success. Instead of hard-mounting everything to a central chassis, design your robot in layers or sections—drivetrain, intake, lift, and outtake—that can be independently removed or replaced. This approach simplifies troubleshooting and makes it easier to iterate between competitions. Standardizing mounting hole patterns and using quick electrical disconnects (like Anderson Powerpoles or JST connectors) can dramatically reduce pit repair time and improve robot reliability.

Strategy should always guide design. The most successful teams don’t just build the “coolest” robot—they build the robot that best executes their chosen scoring path. That might mean prioritizing cycle speed and reliability over complexity or designing for field control tactics like freight hoarding, zone blocking, or rapid parking. A robot that runs a consistent four-cycle pattern every match will often outperform a robot that _can_ do seven cycles but frequently fails.

Finally, serviceability is critical. Your robot should be designed for easy maintenance between matches. Color-coded wiring, clean cable management, and accessible fasteners make a huge difference when time is short in the pit. Use thread locker or nylon lock nuts on high-vibration areas like drivetrains or intakes to reduce the chance of loosening bolts. Design with the assumption that something _will_ break, and ask yourself: how quickly can we fix it?

By combining these advanced design strategies with the core mechanical principles outlined above, your team can build not just a functional robot—but a consistently competitive one.
