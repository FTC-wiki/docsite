# Design Philosophy

### Design Philosophy

Modular design philosophy also plays a key role in competitive success. Instead of hard-mounting everything to a central chassis, design your robot in layers or sections—drivetrain, intake, lift, and outtake—that can be independently removed or replaced. This approach simplifies troubleshooting and makes it easier to iterate between competitions. Standardizing mounting hole patterns and using quick electrical disconnects (like Anderson Powerpoles or JST connectors) can dramatically reduce pit repair time and improve robot reliability.

Strategy should always guide design. The most successful teams don’t just build the “coolest” robot—they build the robot that best executes their chosen scoring path. That might mean prioritizing cycle speed and reliability over complexity or designing for field control tactics like freight hoarding, zone blocking, or rapid parking. A robot that runs a consistent four-cycle pattern every match will often outperform a robot that _can_ do seven cycles but frequently fails.

Finally, serviceability is critical. Your robot should be designed for easy maintenance between matches. Color-coded wiring, clean cable management, and accessible fasteners make a huge difference when time is short in the pit. Use thread locker or nylon lock nuts on high-vibration areas like drivetrains or intakes to reduce the chance of loosening bolts. Design with the assumption that something _will_ break, and ask yourself: how quickly can we fix it?

By combining these advanced design strategies with the core mechanical principles outlined above, your team can build not just a functional robot—but a consistently competitive one.
