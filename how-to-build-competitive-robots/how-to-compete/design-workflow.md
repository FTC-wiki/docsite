# Design Workflow

### Design Workflow

One of the most important habits to develop is a CAD-first workflow. Rather than cutting parts and experimenting physically, strong teams model their entire robot in CAD before building anything. This includes not just major systems like drivetrains and lifts, but also fine details like screw clearances, cable routing, and range-of-motion constraints. Designing in CAD allows you to check for part collisions, run mechanical simulations, and iterate quickly without wasting time or materials. Platforms like Onshape are especially popular due to their collaboration features, and built-in hardware libraries.

Prototyping is still essential, but it should be fast and intentional. The goal of prototyping isn’t just to build something that works—it’s to answer specific design questions. Effective teams use cardboard, foam board, or scrap polycarbonate to test geometry and mechanism concepts before committing to a final version. Each prototype should focus on validating a single factor, such as roller spacing, gear ratios, or sensor placement. Teams that document their results thoroughly, using photos, videos, and notes, are better equipped to justify decisions in their engineering portfolio and iterate with purpose.
