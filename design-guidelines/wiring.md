# Wiring

Good wiring doesn’t just look nice—it prevents damage, reduces electrical noise, and keeps your robot easy to service. Poor wire management is one of the top causes of robot failure in competition.

#### Wiring Principles

* **Secure:** No loose wires or plugs that can fall out or get snagged
* **Labeled:** Each connection should be traceable and ideally labeled
* **Bundled:** Use split loom, braided sleeving, or velcro to bundle similar wires
* **Accessible:** Make sure every plug is reachable without full disassembly

#### Best Practices

* Run wires along the structure—not across open air
* Use strain relief at all connectors (e.g., zip tie the wire to a nearby part)
* Avoid sharp bends that can pinch or fatigue cables
* Keep signal and power wires separate when possible

#### Examples of Good Routing

* A power distribution board mounted to a plate, pre-wired, and connected to the REV Hub with a short harness
* Motor cables run through channels in extrusion or along inside faces of gussets
* Sensors mounted on brackets with their wires zip-tied along an adjacent beam
