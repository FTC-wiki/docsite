# How to Design a Clean Robot

A robot can function just fine while still being cluttered, difficult to maintain, or even unsafe. “Clean” design goes beyond looks—it's about structure, serviceability, and thoughtful planning. A clean robot is easier to fix, debug, and upgrade. Judges and alliance partners notice. Clean design demonstrates engineering maturity.

#### Why Cleanliness Matters

* **Serviceability:** Clean designs allow for quicker swaps, easier cable tracing, and faster troubleshooting between matches.
* **Consistency:** A well-structured robot is easier to program because sensors, mechanisms, and encoders behave predictably.
* **Judge Appeal:** A tidy robot signals that your team understands engineering best practices and cares about quality.

#### Common Signs of a Messy Robot

* Wires crossing over mechanisms or dangling loosely
* Screws that are impossible to reach without full disassembly
* Mechanisms attached at awkward angles without alignment
* Zip ties, tape, and hot glue holding critical components

#### Hallmarks of a Clean Build

* Thoughtful cable routing with strain relief and bundling
* Standardized hardware sizes and symmetrical placement
* Easy access to high-maintenance parts like batteries and motors
* Components mounted squarely and parallel to each other
