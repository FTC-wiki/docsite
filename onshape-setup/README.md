# Onshape setup

### Registering for Onshape <a href="#registering-for-onshape" id="registering-for-onshape"></a>

Onshape provides a free education license for students, giving access to powerful CAD tools for free. The education plan is highly recommended, as it allows users to create private documents and unlocks additional useful features.

To start registering, go to the [Onshape for Education](https://onshape.com/education-plan) page and select "Create a Student Account" on the top left of the page.
