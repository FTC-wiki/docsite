# FTC Insert Tool

## Setting up the FTC Insert Tool

FTC Insert Tool is an Onshape plugin that contains a large library of parts that are often useful in FTC.

To install it, go to the [FTC Insert Tool App](https://cad.onshape.com/appstore/apps/Design%20&%20Documentation/6515cfb91574253b1b96a6ba) in the Onshape Appstore.

Press "Subscribe", then "Get for Free". This will automatically add the FTC Insert Tool to your Onshape account.



After subscribing, the FTC Insert Tool inserter won't show up in already open documents until you reload. This is a first-time thing, though.
