# Featurescripts

FeatureScripts are user-created custom features designed to simplify and enhance the FTC design process.

#### How To Install Featurescripts <a href="#how-to-install-featurescripts" id="how-to-install-featurescripts"></a>

1. Open any Onshape document and go to a Part Studio.
2. Click the button on the toolbar labeled "Add custom features."
   1. If you've previously added any FeatureScripts, one of those may appear instead. In that case, click the dropdown and select the Add button.
3. Paste the link of the OnShape document with the featurescript in it into the search bar
4. Select the featurescripts you want to add to your profile, then exit the box. They will then be accessible in all documents from the same drop-down in the toolbar where you added the feature.

### <mark style="color:green;">Pulley Gen</mark>

This isn't a featurescript, but it is still very useful when creating pulleys.

To use this, you must first copy the document, then go to an assembly and go to: Insert -> Other Documents -> Created By Me. It should be listed there as Pulley Gen - Copy.

### <mark style="color:green;">Belt and Chain gen</mark>

This is used to create highly customizable belts and chains. Pulley/sprocket tooth count is automatically calculated from sketch pitch diameter.

### <mark style="color:green;">Part Lighten</mark>

This is better than Onshape's "Lighten" or "Vent" features, with more control over ribs, cut depth, fillets, etc. It can also give you an estimate on how much weight is being saved.
