# Intro to CAD Course

This course is designed to take you from a complete beginner to confidently modeling a full FTC robot. It emphasizes FTC-specific features and tools through engaging proLing concepts. As you advance, the projects become progressively more independent, yet always provide references to guide you along the way.
