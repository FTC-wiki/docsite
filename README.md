# Design Style

The design of a robot is more than just putting parts together. It's about how all the parts work as a system. The way you approach your robot’s design has a huge impact on how easy it is to build, iterate, fix, and compete with.&#x20;

This section dives into the principles that make FTC robots clean, consistent, and competition-ready. Whether you're designing your first bot or refining your 10th, having a clear design style improves reliability and efficiency across the board.

Clean, modular, and serviceable robots are not accidents. Every benefit is the result of intentional design choices. Every bracket, wire, and spacer should have a purpose, and no mechanism should be harder to reach than necessary. In this section, we break down the visual and structural design elements that make great FTC robots stand out, including standard spacing conventions, wiring discipline, fastener choices, and a mindset for mechanical clarity.

Understanding and applying a consistent design language also makes it easier for new team members to contribute, CAD reviewers to catch mistakes, and for everyone to debug or disassemble the robot during matches or inspections. It even helps judges quickly understand how your robot works.

Here, you'll find breakdowns on visual cleanliness, standardization, modularity, wire management, and construction techniques that are easy to maintain and scale. These best practices are not just about aesthetics—they’re about performance, safety, and professionalism.
