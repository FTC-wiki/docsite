# Brief Website Guide

We highly recommend starting here so you have a good idea of what website features to look out for!

If a [phrase or word is underlined](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], you can hover your cursor over it to learn more about it. The purpose of the annotations is to help with understanding technical phrases to novice members, without disturbing the flow of each article.

internal references will bring you to another page on FTCWIKI while external references will open a different website, which we find helpful and relevant, in another tab.





[^1]: Feel free to hover over any technical terms to learn more about them
