# Plate and standoff construction



A favorite among FTC teams, plate and standoff construction uses 2D-cut flat plates spaced apart using standoffs or stacked plastic spacers. It’s intuitive, easy to service, and perfect for custom drivetrains or slide guides.

#### How It Works

* Two parallel plates form the "walls" of a structure.
* Standoffs, spacers, or bearings are used to connect and align them.
* Motors, shafts, and other hardware are mounted between the plates.

#### Pros

* **Serviceable:** Remove screws to open the assembly like a sandwich.
* **Strong and Rigid:** Parallel plates resist torsion well.
* **Easy to Design:** Plates can be laid out in 2D and stacked.

#### Cons

* **Space-Hungry:** Can get bulky in tight robots.
* **Heavy:** Metal plates and many screws/standoffs add mass.
* **Limited Adjustability:** Mounting patterns are fixed after cutting.

#### FTC Tips

* Use ⅛” aluminum or ⅛”/¼” polycarbonate plates.
* Design mounting holes on a 16mm grid to align with common FTC components.
* Add inspection holes to see bearings and shafts inside.
* Offset holes to match standoff centers—always model screw heads to check clearance.
