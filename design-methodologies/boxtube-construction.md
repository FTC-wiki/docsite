# Boxtube construction

Tube-based construction uses square (or rectangular) extrusion as the main structure. It’s popular for building strong, minimal-friction drivetrains, arms, and linear slide supports. Teams often use aluminum tubing or extruded building systems like REV or GoBILDA.

#### How It Works

* Structural members are made from 1x1" aluminum tube or extrusion.
* Plates, brackets, or gussets are bolted to the tube faces.
* Components like slides or bearings ride along or inside the tubing.

#### Pros

* **Very Rigid:** Tubing resists bending, great for arms and frames.
* **Modular Mounting:** You can tap into tube faces or use brackets.
* **Efficient Use of Space:** Great strength-to-volume ratio.

#### Cons

* **Requires Precision:** Drilling/tapping holes straight is critical.
* **Difficult to Modify:** Custom tube setups don’t allow sliding or quick realignment.
* **Access Needed:** Tube interiors are hard to reach once closed off.

#### FTC Tips

* Use 1x1” 1/16” wall aluminum tubing (e.g., 6061-T6) for strong but light framing.
* Tap ends for M3 or M4 screws using 3D-printed guides or jigs.
* Clamp or bolt corner gussets for rigid 90° joints.
* Consider nested ¾” tube inside 1” for telescoping mechanisms.
