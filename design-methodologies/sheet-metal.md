# Sheet Metal

Sheet metal design involves cutting 2D flat parts—usually from aluminum or polycarbonate—and bending them to form rigid 3D structures. Common in professional manufacturing, this method brings high strength-to-weight ratios and sleek results to FTC when used with laser cutters, waterjets, or CNC routers.

#### How It Works

* Parts are designed in a flat form and cut from a sheet.
* Bends are made with a brake, hand bender, or pliers (for thin plastic).
* Holes, cutouts, and slots are added during cutting, enabling precise integration.

#### Pros

* **Strong and Lightweight:** Folded edges reinforce structural stiffness.
* **Custom Fit:** Integrate mounting points, wire routing, and geometry directly into part design.
* **Low Profile:** Flat geometry makes it ideal for tight packaging.

#### Cons

* **Requires Planning:** You must account for bend radii, reliefs, and K-factors (bend stretching).
* **Tooling Needed:** Bending aluminum cleanly requires a brake.
* **Not Modular:** Parts are purpose-built and difficult to reuse on other bots.

#### FTC Tips

* Use 5052 aluminum in 0.04–0.063" thickness for easy bending.
* Design for _single-direction bends_ to keep parts simple.
* Avoid sharp 90° interior corners—use radiused slots to prevent stress cracks.
* Polycarbonate sheet can be heat bent and is easier to prototype.
